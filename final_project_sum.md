# The idea
This idea comes from my hobby: basketball. I like playing basketball very much and I am interested in every aspect of NBA. During my busy study in school, playing basketball makes me feel fresh and keeps me healthy. I want to share some inspirations that I got from basketball. 

I tried to combine my story with story arc buying showing how different data from NBA shocked and inspired me. And I draw several scratch as a starting point of my project.
