[The idea](/final_project_jiang.md)

This idea comes from my hobby: basketball. I like playing basketball very much and I am interested in every aspect of NBA. During my busy study in school, playing basketball makes me feel fresh and keeps me healthy. I want to share some inspirations that I got from basketball. I tried to combine my story with story arc buying showing how different data from NBA shocked and inspired me. And I draw several scratch as a starting point of my project.

[Design and user research](/final_project_PartII.md)

To further my story, I applied the techniques from class: storyboard and wirefram.
I was new to storyboard. Even after some research, I still felt a little struggled to construct a story. Every story has its own leading role, but I don't have one. Suddenly, it occurred to me that why don't I depick a fictious person to be the lead of the story and share my inspiration within the story. Therefore, I created John, the lead of this story. After this, I begin to design the boards.

I also tried to make some fluctuation in the stories because audience usually do not like a flat story line. Then I depict some mootion fluctuation of John within the story giving the data he got from NBA. At last, of course, we will call out that we should love our study, enjou our life and keep a good life balance. I also invited some classmates to review my story for feedback. I will discuss more in audience session.

Combined with all research before, I began to put togethe my story in shorthand, a powerful visulization website tool. It did take some time to learn the operation of shorthand. However, After I got the basics, I found it enjoyable to throw my creation on the website. Together with the powerful dataviz embedding, I finished my final story step by step.

# Audience
The majority audience of this story were college students who have general interest in basketball and NBA. In the very begining, I found that people who love basketball enjoyed my story much a lot. However, I also found for people who are unfamiliar with NBA, some detailed data and information may be confusing to them. The purpose of this story should be more than sharing the excitement with NBA fans. I also want more people to find inspiration from my story.

To achieve this, I showed more friendly statistics and data visualization. I emphasized the process how John get inspiration from the story instead of describing a lot of NBA knowledge. And I make a common but meaningful call for action in the end to rise the inspiration of more audience.
