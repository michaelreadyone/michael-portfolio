# Storyboard
Here the story begins by presenting a fictitious international college student who love both his major-computer science and basketball. He wants to be a good programmer in the future but he also dreams about playing basketball in NBA. He does some research of NBA players' data and realizes that it would be very hard for him to be a NBA player. Meanwhile, he also feels pressure in his major because he thinks most of his classmates are smarter than him. Then he wants to see among all NBA players, do all-star NBA players have advantages in physical conditions? To his surprise, all-star players almost have the same heights and weights comparing to all players. This brings confidence to him. Now he knows that those physical conditions won't stop him from being an excellent student in computer science and have a good career in the future. By checking the changing rate of foreign player also brings him the confidence that U.S. gives fare chance to foreign people as long as they work hard.
