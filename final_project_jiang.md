# Outline

**Summary**

This is a project about the showing the stories and data visualization of some interesting facts about NBA. As a basketball fan, NBA is definitely a big place to pay attention to. I know that all NBA players are very tall and strong, and their salaries are also crazy high. However, I want to know the exact values of their heights, weights and salaries. I also want to dig more information from those players. I want to know many things including but not limit to:
- What are the weights and heights  distribution for NBA players?
- What are the weights and heights  distribution for NBA all-star players?
- Are the player's salaries matching their performance?
- Are top drafted players doing better than other players?
- What are the portions of foreign players in NBA and how do they perform in the league?
    
Besides, what inspiration could those data bring to people? Most people, for sure, do not have those exceptional body characteristics. So what can we learn from those NBA giants? To answer those questions, I found some very useful public data about NBA players from Kaggle. Combining what I learned from this class, I want to choose the most effective ways of visualization to show the data and also want to discover the inspiration from those data. 




**Story arc and elements**
  - Arc drawing:
  ![](images/StoryArc.png)

    - Also show how top drafted players perform during next five year, including the salary, game performance index.
  - (-) Stage D
    - Create another tension
    - By far, how do you think about the portion of foreign players in NBA? show the portion of foreign players overall.
  - (+) Stage E
    - Relief again
    - Show the changing rate of foreign playes in the league.
    - NBA is open to more and more players around the world. Just train hard and you will get the opportunity.
  - Call for action
    - love what you love, do what you do. Don't feel unqualified if you are not a talented person in you area. also don't feel overpround if you already have some accoplishment in your area. Stick to the area that you love and work hard and you will achieve your goal.
    - It doesn't matter where you come from. As long as you work hard towards your target, you will get an acception and acknowledge in U.S.

# Data
- Data 1: NBA players data
    - https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data
    - General information of NBA player data will be used from this resource. Player heights and weights will be applide to draw distribution graphs.

- Data 2: NBA all star games 2000-2016
    - https://www.kaggle.com/fmejia21/nba-all-star-game-20002016
    - General information of all-star NBA player data will be extracted here. Heights and weights information will be added to the comparision between NBA players vs NBA all-star players graphs.

- Data 3: NBA - Player Salary (1990-2017)
    - https://www.kaggle.com/whitefero/nba-player-salary-19902017
    - Salary information of NBA players will be get here. Those data will be used to draw bar charts to show the NBA players income.

    - Information of drafted players is from here. A performance tracking will be show from this data to show how those top drafted player perform through the years. And more insteresting charts may be generated from here.



# Method and medium
For this project, I started here in github to give some initial ideas with outlines and sketches. Based on the stroy arc and elements. I will add more details into those structures and I will continue diging more interesting stories and adding more insightful data visualizations from those data about NBA players. I will tried most vistualization tools from the class and choose the most effective ways to do the data visualization. I will also frequently ask my peers to review my work and give me feedback so that I know my ideas are properply demonstrated. From the demonstration of Shorthand in class, I found that this would be a great tool to show my idea and therefore I will choose Shorthand as my project platform.
