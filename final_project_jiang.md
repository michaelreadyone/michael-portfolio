# Outline

**Summary**

This is a project about the showing the stories and data visualization of some interesting facts about NBA. As a basketball fan, NBA is defenitely a big place to pay attention to. I konw that all NBA palyers are very tall and strong, and their salaries are also crazy high. However, I want to know the exact values of their heights, weights and salaries. I also want to dig more information from those players. I want to know many things including but not limit to:
    - What are the weights and hieights distribution for NBA players?
    - What are the weights and hieights distribution for NBA all star players?
    - Are the player's salary matching their performance?
    - Are top drafted players doing better than other players?
    - What are the portions of foreign players in NBA and how did they performance?
    
Besides, what inspiration could those data bring to people? Most people, for sure, do not have those exceptional body characteristics. What can we learn from the data from those NBA giants? To answer those questions, I found some very useful public data about NBA from Kaggle. Combining what I learned from this class, I want to choose the most effective ways of visualization to show the data and also want to discover the inspiration of those data to people.

  - Call for action
    - love what you love, do what you do. Don't feel unqualified if you are not a top beginner in the road, also don't feel overpride if you begin your job with a high skilled equipment. Stick to the things that you love and work hard and you will get the job done
    - It doesn't matter that much if you are a top pic or not, this also applies everwhere. You need to work hard to get to your goal. You don't need to be dicoffident if you didn't start as a top biginner. You also need to word hard if you are a top biginner.

    - Information of drafted players is from here. More insteresting charts will be generated from here.



# Method and medium
For this project, I started here from github to giving some initial ideas with outlines and sketches. Based on the stroy arc and elements. I will continue to think about diging more interesting stories and adding more insightful data visualizations. I will tried most vistualization tools from the class and choose the best ways to do the data visualization. I will frequently ask my peers to review my work and give me feedback so that I know my ideas are properply demonstrated. From the demonstration of Shorthand in class, I found that this would be a great tool to show my idea and therefore I will choose Shorthand as my project platform.
