This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Michael(Jiang) Chang. I use pronounces He/His. I am currently in MISM-BIDA 12 track and will graduate on Aug 2020. I graduated from materials science and had been worked as a materials scientist for 3 years. Exposing to a lot of data process and visualization work at my previously work really fascinated me and I knew this is skill I love and now I am here learning data science!

## What I hope to learn
As a student in data science. I divide my learning in two parts: data processing(deal with machine) and data demonstration(deal with people). This course will be a great help in the second part. I Want to learn how to scientifically and esthetically apply the type of chart, coloring, labeling and scaling to best present data. I want to learn how to prepare the visualization bases on different audience and environment. I also want to learn how to build and maintain an online portfolio. The ultimate goal is to effectively and rapidly demonstrate my interpretation of the data to my audience.
