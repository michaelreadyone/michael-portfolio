# The idea
This idea comes from my hobby: basketball. I like playing basketball very much and I am interested in every aspect of NBA. During my busy study in school, playing basketball makes me feel fresh and keeps me healthy. I want to share some inspirations that I got from basketball. 

I tried to combine my story with story arc buying showing how different data from NBA shocked and inspired me. And I draw several scratch as a starting point of my project.

# Design and user research
To further my story, I applied the techniques from class: storyboard and wirefram.
I was new to storyboard. Even after some research, I still felt a little struggled to construct a story. Every story has its own leading role, but I don't have one. Suddenly, it occurred to me that why don't I depick a fictious person to be the lead of the story and share my inspiration within the story. Therefore, I created John, the lead of this story. After this, I begin to design the boards.

I also tried to make some fluctuation in the stories because audience usually do not like a flat story line. Then I depict some mootion fluctuation of John within the story giving the data he got from NBA. At last, of course, we will call out that we should love our study, enjou our life and keep a good life balance.

I also invited some classmates to review my story for feedback. I will discuss details in next session.

# Final data story

From all the reasults and feedback from Part I and Part II. I make follow changes and add more efforts to compelete the final story.

**Audience**
The majority audience of this story would be college students who have general interest in basketball and NBA. In the very begining, I found that people who also love basketball enjoyed my story much. but for people have barely knowledge in NBA  intended to tell the story to only NBA fans. After some interview I found for people who are unfamiliar with NBA, some detailed data about NBA may be confusing to them. The purpose of this story is not introducing NBA, is to show other people how you can get inspiration from your hobby and gain confidence in your study

Then I decided to use some friendly statiscly
