### **The idea**

This idea comes from my hobby: basketball. I like playing basketball very much and I am interested in every aspect of NBA. During my busy study in school, playing basketball makes me feel fresh and keeps me healthy. I want to share some inspirations that I got from basketball. I tried to combine my story with story arc by showing how different data from NBA shocked and inspired me. And I draw several scratches as a starting point of my project.[Link to part I](/final_project_jiang.md)

### **Design and user research**

To further my story, I applied the techniques from class: storyboards and wireframes.
I was new to storyboards. Even after some research, I still felt a little struggled to construct the storyboards. Every story has its own leading role, but I didn't have one. Suddenly, it occurred to me that why don't I create a fictitious person to lead the story and share my inspiration within the story. Therefore, I created John, the lead of this story. After this, my storyboards progressed more smoothly. 

I also tried to make some fluctuation in the stories because audience usually do not like a flat story line. Then I built some emotional turns of John caused by his viewing of NBA data. At last, I have a call for action that we should love our study, enjoy our life and keep a good life balance. I also invited some classmates to review my story for feedback. I will discuss more in audience session.[Link to part II](/final_project_PartII.md)

### **Final data story**

Combined with all research before, I began to put together my story in shorthand, a powerful visualization website tool. It did take some time to learn the operation of shorthand. However, After I got the basics, I found it enjoyable to test my creation on the website. Together with the powerful dataviz embedding, I finished my final story step by step.[Link to story webpage](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/john-s-inspiration-from-his-nba-discoveries/index.html)

# Audience
The majority audience of this story were college students who have general interest in basketball and NBA. In the very beginning, I found that people who love basketball enjoyed my story a lot. However, I also found that for people who are unfamiliar with NBA, some detailed data and information may be confusing to them. The purpose of this story should be more than sharing the excitement with NBA fans. I also want more people to find inspiration from my story.

To achieve this goal, I showed more friendly statistics and data visualization. I emphasized the process how John get inspiration from the story instead of describing a lot of NBA knowledge. And I made a common but meaningful call for action in the end to resonate with audience.
