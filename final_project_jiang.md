# Outline

- Summary
  This is a project about the data visualization of some interestings fact about NBA from 2000 to 2016. As a person interested in Basketball, NBA is defenitely a big place to pay attention to. From those public datas about NBA I want to know many things including but not limit to:
    - What are the weights and hieights distribution for NBA players?
    - What are the weights and hieights distribution for NBA all star players?
    - Are the player's salary matching their performance?
    - Are top drafted players doing better than other players?
    - What are the portions of foreign players in NBA and how did they performance?
Combining what I learned from this class, I want to choose the most effective ways of visualization to demostrate those ideas. 



- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.



- Story arc and elements
  - Tension in the begining 
    - NBA salaries
    - The height and weight distribution for NBA players and show that it is difficuilt to be a NBA player
    - It's not easy to be a NBA players
  - Happy relief
    - Among all NBA players, all star players don't outstand other players in those standards(also provide some T test for picky audience)
    - This tell us as long as you are in one area, like us, some will be data analyst in the future, your pythical condition can not stop from you being a outstanding data analyst
  - Another way to proof this
    - show how top drafted players perform during next five year, including the salary, game performance index.
  - Create another tenstion
    - By far, how do you think the portion of foreign players in NBA? show the portion of foreign players overall.
  - Relief again
    - NBA is open to more and more players around the world. Just train hard and you will get the oppotunity.
  - Call for action
    - love what you love, do what you do. Don't feel unqualified if you are not a top beginner in the road, also don't feel overpride if you begin your job with a high skilled equipment. Stick to the things that you love and work hard and you will get the job done
    - It doesn't matter that much if you are a top pic or not, this also applies everwhere. You need to work hard to get to your goal. You don't need to be dicoffident if you didn't start as a top biginner. You also need to word hard if you are a top biginner.
